“I feel lonely” – we have all felt this in our lives before. Loneliness arises when we feel disconnected from the people in our lives, [especially when we cannot find like-minded people in our surroundings](https://sliceofpower.com/2023-04-24-3-reasons-you-feel-lonely-and-what-you-can-do/). 

It often means that we're not experiencing the emotional closeness and understanding that comes from meaningful connections. We may experience a lack of support and recognition, leading to a sense of loneliness. In worse scenarios, people may distance themselves from you because they don't like you for who you are or because of your quirks. 

However, this doesn’t have to be the case. You always have one person by your side and that is yourself.

## My Story

<div class="box-purple" style="font-size:17px; text-align: left; padding-top:1.9375rem;padding-bottom:0.8rem">
  <p>As for me, I’m not quite fond of having a bunch of friends or acquaintances to begin with. I only value close friendships with a few people.</p>
  <p>Just like anyone, I've had people I really cared about come and go in my life too. Grieving over loss feels even more agonizing than being alone, I later realized.</p>
  <p>Once, I had a long-distance close friend. We would only talk every couple of days or weeks, as she was always busy with life. There were times when she wouldn’t respond for months even.</p>
  <p>I was always so happy whenever we could talk! But I inevitably felt lonely and gloomy whenever we stopped talking for weeks. It was as if nothing else could bring me joy, as I really despised my environment back then.</p>
  <p>After some time, yet another extended period of silence, I got tired of waiting on her. I began to reflect on my situation.</p>
  <p style="text-align:center;font-style:italic;"><b>"Why do I only feel genuine happiness when I’m talking to her? What is it about her that gives me happiness?"</b></p>
  <p>To be honest, she wasn’t even that great of a friend - she wasn’t around when I needed support the most.</p>
  <p>Answer: Her presence made me feel loved. She was nice to me. I felt warmth just by chatting with her.</p>
</div>

I wasn’t finding joy in other areas of my life. I wasn’t loving myself.

In fact, I used to hate myself a lot. I was always seeking love from elsewhere since I couldn’t receive the love and recognition I wanted from my family.

I eventually realized how unhealthy it was to depend on others to receive warmth and comfort. If I could learn to be comfortable with who I am, I wouldn't need someone else's presence to feel okay. 

## The 3 that Things Taught Me How to Overcome Loneliness:

<h3 style="padding-top: 27px;">1. It's About Your Ego</h3>

<div class="box-success" style="background-color:#e3ffcf; border-left-color:#e3ffcf; padding-top: 1.9rem;">
  <p><b>Consider these questions:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Are you willing to let go of the “need” for other people?</li>
<li>Why do you feel the urge to have someone by your side?</li>
<li>Why do you need to be validated by someone else?</li>
<li>What's stopping you from give yourself the validation you receive from others?</li>
</ul>
</div>

What is causing your loneliness? For many people, it might be the lack of a supportive family, friends, a significant other, etc. But think about it, what exactly are you wanting from them? What do you need from them? Are you able to give yourself the very same things that you want from others?

Like what the author mentioned [here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20140710144736-28584737-ego-loneliness), you may for instance, have a friend whom you like very much. You and your friend exchange texts or calls everyday and you feel that you cannot live without them. However, if they get busy and can't talk for a few days, you start feeling bored and uneasy.

You always want someone’s attention and cannot be by yourself. You need the constant validation of how important you are through the presence of someone.

**You need to put down that “ego”.** Perhaps you have a natural expectation that someone should be here with you. Someone that will make you feel important. Without someone, you feel unimportant and lonely.

While it can be argued that humans are social creatures and thus, naturally feel the need to belong to a group in order to be happy, that’s not an official criteria for having a good life. This “approach” does not fit everyone, [as some people feel more comfortable without the ‘need to belong’.](https://medium.com/@karen.geddis/being-okay-with-not-wanting-to-belong-16840ca66409)

Just like my story, I had an ego in me, thinking that I needed my friend’s presence in order to feel valued and loved. 

However, true and everlasting love only comes from within you.

You don’t need someone by your side to feel loved or important, because you already are important for yourself.

While some people might be lucky to have people by their side, that’s their fate and lives. No one said that you must be around people in order to feel loved and happy. [Never compare your situation to that of others as we each have our own unique challenges to go through.](https://sliceofpower.com/2023-03-01-why-you-should-not-compare-yourself-to-others/)

You can give love to yourself, and in fact, that’s the most important type of love. Taking good care of yourself by eating healthy, keeping yourself active and learning to manage your emotions by your own self, is the best treatment to yourself. 

Let go of that ego, for you are already valued by yourself. Your happiness should not be dependent on others.

### 2. Acceptance & Acknowledgment

ith loneliness. It’s just a state of being and your reaction towards it. There is no need to push away the fact that you’re alone or lonely as there is nothing to feel ashamed of. It happens in life. What helped me to overcome loneliness was to accept my current situation. To take it as is and accept myself for who I am.

- Accept that you’re unable to find connections with the right people **for the time being.** 
- Accept yourself for who you are, and you don’t need anyone else.
- Accept that it is **completely ok to be alone.**

For example, if you lack friends and you choose to feel sad over it, you'll feel sad over it. 

If you don’t associate sadness to it, but rather, view it positively, as quality time or a chance to grow stronger, it will not feel as sad as it seems. It could be an inspiring moment if you make it to be. 

Undoubtedly, this is easier said than done. But my point is, loneliness is not a bad thing nor is it something to be ashamed of. 

Self-acceptance plays a key role in freeing yourself. That is to acknowledge yourself for who you are, and to become comfortable with being by yourself.

Sometimes, it’s also part of the Universe’s plans to make you go through this alone. 

This could be a challenge for you to start learning to focus on yourself, start recognizing your merits and power, all on your own! Not through someone else! You have the ability to make yourself feel valued and loved.

From my own experience, had I continued relying on other people’s accompaniment for happiness, I wouldn’t have started learning to love myself. Self-love isn’t easy, but it can be done. It took me a little over a year to feel more assured of myself, to start loving myself. 

Cultivating self-love might take a long time, but be patient with yourself. Don’t stress over it. Just remember that you are always the first person to support yourself, no matter what you encounter. Love yourself for that.

### 3. Realizing You Always Have Yourself, No Matter What

No one is meant to be by your side forever. We entered this world alone, and one day, we'll depart alone. This makes it all the more important to show the utmost love to yourself.

People and things in life are unpredictable. People come and go in our lives, people move, people get into fights, people stop liking you and so on.

**Whatever happens, only you will always be by your side.**

No one else is as loyal to you as you are to yourself. No one else is as reliable as you in this regard – you always have yourself to rely on. You never need to fear of losing yourself.

You will definitely always have yourself. That’s the only thing that matters – to not give up on yourself. 

You deserve love. If no one else is able to love and appreciate you for who you are, be the first one to love yourself.

Thank yourself for staying strong, for going through all the obstacles that you’ve been through. 

Cherish and appreciate yourself—mind and body—because they work tirelessly each day to keep you alive and functioning at your best. 

Once you’ve learned to be comfortable with yourself, to get along with only yourself, you will never be bothered by the idea of loneliness again.

It's a very different kind of satisfaction once you've reached this stage.
