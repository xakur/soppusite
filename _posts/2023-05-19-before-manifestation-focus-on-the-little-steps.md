What does it take to manifest our goals? Why does the thought of having to manifest something feel like a tedious task? The idea of manifestation actually stresses me out a bit. There is too much emphasis on the destination and it makes me overthink and worry about whether I will succeed or not.

<div style="text-align:center;">
<p><b>I want to think about something simpler.</b></p>
<p>Instead of fantasizing about the big goal,</p>
<p><b>I want to think about the little steps that take us there.</b></p></div>

A long-term goal is made up of a series of short-term goals or rather, small tasks. To manifest your goals, it is important to be consistent in completing these small tasks that you need to do on a daily or regular basis.

Unfortunately, there may be factors along the way that stop us in our journey, e.g. we become unmotivated, we procrastinate or simply, we feel sad and cannot move on etc. The small tasks might seem dreadful and intimidating at times. 

<div class="box-purple" style="background-color:#feffd0; padding-bottom:0.7rem;">
<p>Hence, we should <b>focus on keeping up with these small tasks/little steps.</b></p>
<p>We need to <b>ensure</b> that these <b>small tasks give us continuing happiness</b>, so that we do not see these tasks as chores that we are obliged to do.</p>
<p><b>By being happy in the process, we can be consistent in our actions.</b></p>
</div>

Once you've become consistent, performing these tasks would eventually become a habit and part of your lifestyle. Here are 3 easy ways that can help you establish a consistent routine, so that you can hold yourself accountable in your journey.

## 1. Find enjoyment in every small task

Find enjoyment in every step. It is your goal/dream for a reason. No matter how difficult it is to achieve the ultimate goal, there is certainly something that you truly enjoy about it. Something that prompted you to take on this journey in the first place. So what is it? What joy does the activity give you? Rely on that fun and enjoyment wholeheartedly.

What's fun about it while you are in the process of doing these small tasks? It is **more important to focus on the positive feelings you get from the process**, than to think about the "good feelings" you imagine you would get from the end result. Focus on living in the moment. The past is gone and we cannot predict or control the future. [It is a lot more helpful to focus on the what's happening right now, as we can only control the present](https://nafc.org/bhealth-blog/the-importance-of-living-in-the-moment/). Cherish the present moment and enjoy what is fun about the task at hand right now.

So how can you keep yourself reminded of what's fun about the activity?

On a piece of paper, list 5 things that are fun about the activity (i.e. the small task(s) that make up your big goal, that you have to do). Think about what makes you smile while doing the tasks. Which part of it makes you enjoy and feel lighter? Certainly, there are difficulties in any given task, but finding joy and reminding yourself of the fun aspects will make them more tolerable. It gives you something to look forward to.

Whenever you feel dreadful about the task, look at this piece of paper to remind yourself of the fun that you will receive from doing this task. The fun of the task will be what keeps you consistent in doing it. Keep reminding yourself. Despite the challenges, you are enjoying it too.

Ultimately, the practice of being consistent would eventually form into a habit. The process will become less intimidating to go through, and would become an automatic thing to do. Being consistent in doing what needs to be done will help you achieve your goal.

## 2. Incorporate daily affirmations

Affirmations or daily affirmations are positive statements that affirm you of your abilities, reinforce your confidence and uplift your spirits, helping you to stay motivated. The affirmations can foster a positive mindset when trying to complete the seemingly dreadful small tasks that make up our big goal. When you find things difficult and feel like procrastinating, these affirmations serve as words of encouragement to push you forward.

We need these reminders sometimes as it might be easy to forget our own strengths. Personally, positive affirmations help to calm me down whenever I'm feeling overwhelmed. It helps me to feel more at peace with myself, especially when I suddenly doubt myself. We all have moments like this in life. In addition to the various ways that you can adopt to help you stay hopeful in times of self-doubt, positive affirmations are a good way to help you feel better too. And affirming yourself daily can reduce the tendency of doubting yourself when you internalize the positive beliefs over time.

We can get engulfed by our own emotions without noticing, and this can happen through external influences as well; you might start doubting your abilities when you see someone who is a lot better than you. This is where (daily) affirmations can help you stay rooted to yourself.

Affirmations can be done in various ways. It can be in the form of repeating positive quotes and sentences to yourself, depending on which area you would like to reinforce. For example, if you want to become more confident, you can say and repeat to yourself, "I'm confident!" or "The only approval I need is myself." Alternatively, you can do this by writing it down on a piece of paper or a sticky note and stick it to your wall. There are also affirmation card decks that you can purchase from sites like [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/) or [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/).

**Examples of Positive Affirmations:**
<ul class="box-beige" style="padding-left:2rem;">
<li>I am successful. I am worthy of my dreams.</li>
<li>I accept who I am.</li>
<li>I will love myself and be kind to myself.</li>
<li>I am good enough for myself.</li>
<li>I forgive myself for my past.</li>
<li>My past mistakes have made me stronger.</li>
</ul>

Some of these cards have pleasing designs and contain very encouraging words. You can choose to shuffle and draw a card everyday or as and when you like. I would normally redraw a card every other day and have the card placed on my table so that I could see it while I work on my tasks. On top of that, there are plenty of positive affirmations videos on YouTube that you can listen to as well.

It is ideal to incorporate daily affirmations into your life, as they act as reminders to **help you feel better about yourself and your journey**. The words of encouragement can provide relief when you feel frustrated about yourself. At the same time, they remind you of your inner strength to help you to stay on track and cultivate a positive mindset.

When keeping a positive mindset becomes a habit, it will become a natural state. When faced with other difficulties, you will feel that you have enough mental capacity to get through them. Being in a comfortable state of mind will help you move forward and be consistent in your efforts to complete the small tasks that lead you to your goal. 

## 3. Reward yourself for every small achievement

To keep yourself focused on completing the seemingly unfavorable tasks necessary to achieve your big goal, you may choose to reward yourself for every little task done. **Rewards can provide motivation**. When we feel overwhelmed by the issue(s) at hand, we may end up not doing anything instead. Therefore, it is important to do whatever it takes to help you stay consistent in doing something that will ultimately achieve your goal. Implementing practices such as rewarding yourself may help to make the task at hand more favorable, as there is something to look forward to after completing the task.

Rewarding yourself can be in tangible or intangible terms. Examples for tangible rewards: a favorite snack or a good meal. Examples for intangible rewards: have a nice long bubble bath or play some games after the task for the day is done.

**Have discipline** to reward yourself when the time comes, and make sure that you have completed whatever you have planned for the day.

Having breaks in between when working on your tasks is also necessary. Rest can help you go a long way. However, **it is important to not treat rest as a reward**. As humans, we all need rest when we feel tired. We deserve rest and it does not need to be earned.

## Conclusion

Simply put, do whatever it takes to keep going to complete the necessary tasks that make up the big goal. The key thing is to be consistent in your execution, which will ultimately help to manifest your desires. Focus on the favorable parts of the required tasks at hand to keep you happy and consistent in your journey. Without stressing over what might happen in the future, focus on what you can do in the present. Develop ways to support and encourage yourself.
