Have you ever completed something and felt like, despite the admiration from others, what you just did doesn't feel like something significant? Or that people are just being kind to you? 

That’s me most of the time. I either don’t feel anything or I would feel strange when I receive admiration or praises like this. “It’s not that big of a deal! So many people have accomplished it”, I’d think to myself.

It’s easy to brush off my achievements, thinking that they were nothing since so many other people have achieved the same thing. So why would it be something worth acknowledging or celebrating?

I reflected upon this recently after someone told me that they were impressed by my work. I thought nothing of it at first, but as I thought back on the journey, I recalled how much pain I had to go through in order to finally achieve what I had in mind. It wasn’t just a walk in the park. In fact, it had been a frustrating journey full of self-doubt because I wasn’t very familiar with the topic at hand. I had to seek my own resources and do everything by myself.

If people could see the hard work and quality I put into my work, why can’t I do the same for myself? Why am I belittling the work I had done? The amount of time and effort put in should not go unrecognized. We shouldn’t discount our achievements, whether big or small.

## How I Failed to Appreciate my Efforts

I’ve been told by a couple of people that I’m really hard on myself. I often find it difficult to view my achievements as a job well done. As I thought about it further, I realized that I'm indeed often rushing from one task to the other. I don’t give myself space or time to rest and appreciate what I just completed. My mind often goes like this:

_“Ok, now that I’m done with part A (after much difficulty), it’s now time to move on to part B! Let’s go! No time to waste! I’ve already wasted too much time in part A.”_

I often don’t give myself a breather or rather, don’t think that I deserve a breather. This is especially so when the tasks are “expected” of me. Both easy and difficult tasks. For the difficult ones, if I had spent a lot more time than what I had expected, I would blame myself for spending too much time, and get upset with myself. I couldn't appreciate my efforts and my mind would always think...

_"So many other random people around the world have accomplished the same things... My completion of these very same things isn't something significant."_

I was always like this and I only realized how unreasonable I was after I briefly shared with a few people what I was dealing with.

When I was criticizing myself for moving too slowly and for lacking motivation on certain days, they comforted me that it was normal to feel that way. Learning takes time, especially in the beginning, and I was still learning. There were many areas that I had to work on based on what I was doing, and everything takes time. In fact, this is why some people undergo specialized training in a given field in order to be employed solely for a specific function.

Moreover, as I was handling everything on my own, it was only logical that I needed extra time to figure things out and get them done.

From this recent encounter, I’ve gained a better understanding of why we shouldn’t discount our achievements:

## It’s your own breakthrough. Don’t compare your achievements against the “norm”.

There is no need to measure your achievements against what’s considered “standard” or “norm”. It is unnecessary to think about what others have already accomplished and let that discourage you.

Everyone’s life path is different. It is silly to think that you are not doing enough just because others have done and achieved more. We pursue different things at different timings and we grow at different rates. Some people achieve a certain goal sooner, while some later than the others. It is never fair to compare ourselves to others as we all have different life situations and even upbringing. [Comparing to others amounts to nothing at the end of the day.](https://sliceofpower.com/2023-03-01-why-you-should-not-compare-yourself-to-others/)

<h3 style="text-align:center;">It should always be you VS you.</h3>

It’s your own breakthrough that matters the most. This occurs at various points in our lives as we continue to improve ourselves. From one breakthrough to the other. Instead of thinking about what you fall short of as compared to others, think about your **personal achievements and breakthroughs** – what you had failed to do in the past, but are able to do now. You shouldn’t be thinking about how much you’ve completed according to the success of someone else.

## Every achievement, whether big or small, contributes to your final goal.

I do look up to several people and have a high expectation of myself. I think it’s fine to have our own standards. It’s a matter of personal preference. Ideally, we should maintain a balance in everything. We can aim higher and not settle for anything less, but we should not be overly critical of ourselves too. We need to remember that it is our personal breakthrough that matters the most and we should **recognize every personal achievement, whether big or small**.

Just because something is self-perceived as “easy” and “expected” does not mean that there’s no value behind it. [On the contrary, we might even become demotivated by the thought of trying to accomplish a big goal as it can seem overwhelming at times](https://sliceofpower.com/2023-05-19-how-to-manifest-something-focus-on-the-little-steps/). Hence, it may be more helpful to focus on the small steps or small tasks instead. After all, every little task make up the final goal.

Although it can be easy to think that these smaller tasks are considered “expected duties”, they are just as important as any other more difficult or significant tasks and processes. We need them to reach our goal. We should also recognize our efforts put into these small tasks, and give ourselves a pat on the back upon completion. [Acknowledging your efforts more often can help you to feel more assured and confident of yourself.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/2021/04/22/boost-your-self-confidence-with-self-acknowledgement/?sh=5177dd461319)

On the other hand, we should not blame ourselves for taking a longer time to complete any difficult task either. Especially when the given task at hand is something new or that we are inexperienced in, it only makes sense to spend a substantial amount of time to get it done.

I often blame myself for spending too much time on figuring things out. For some reason, I expect myself to solve issues quickly. But truth is, I hadn’t even learned of the new skills that were required to complete the tasks, so how was I going to complete them quickly? I realized that I really needed to be patient with myself. 

For any difficult task or process that is part of a big goal that you are trying to achieve, instead of thinking about completing the task right away, it would be helpful to be more flexible with yourself. Allocate a reasonable amount of time to acquire any new information or skills before working on the task. By taking the time to learn the required skills, it would help you be more efficient in completing the task.

## Be happy that you started doing something.

Be happy that you have taken action! There’s significance behind starting something that seems daunting. We should feel proud of ourselves for having the bravery to follow our own desires and take action. And for some of us, we finally did something that we had failed to do in the past. We should be happy that we finally took action and persevered. 

How many people are willing to make a change? Or are willing to do something different to achieve a desired state? I’m not sure of the numbers, but it’s far too often in life that we hear people saying that they want to do this or that, but end up not doing anything at all.

Therefore, **even if we might have spent too much time on it, we deserve credit for starting something and seeing it through**. It takes courage and a strong will. Although progress might have been slow, what matters most is not to stop moving. Be happy about the completion of every task, and for keeping up with your journey

Now that you’ve reached a significant milestone and have become more familiarized with the process, you will only work with greater ease and efficiency in your road ahead.

## Conclusion

Any task or achievement, whether big or small, contributes to your final goal at the end of the day.  We should not discount our achievement even if it was something we felt that was easy and expected of us. We need to remember not to be too hard on ourselves, and recognize every effort that we put in to get things completed. Our souls will continue to stay motivated as we acknowledge our achievements.
