We often hear of how important it is to love ourselves. Self-love is essentially a commitment to yourself—attending to personal needs and desires, embracing your true self, and acknowledging and appreciating your worth. When you are grateful for yourself, loving yourself will come naturally.

<p style="font-size:20px;font-weight:bold;">Self-Love starts with Self-Appreciation.</p>

As you appreciate yourself, you acknowledge yourself and see yourself in positive light. You respect and forgive yourself for your flaws.

## The Idea of Self-Love Used to Repulse Me

Unfortunately, self-love does not come easily for some people.

I used to hate myself and the thought of loving myself always disgusted me. My mind would go: _“Love myself? No way! I suck! I’m terrible! I’m a failure! I’m the worst! Why should I love myself when I’m so pathetic?”_

I often had those feelings and the idea of loving myself never sat well with me. Why should I love myself when I’m not even excelling at something? Why should I love myself when I’m not good enough?

I thought I wasn’t worthy of love because all I could see were my flaws and mistakes.

For those of us who **didn't receive love from our family** or environment while growing up, **recognizing our own worth can be a common struggle.**

Especially if you have **experienced abuse,** whether physical or verbal, the cruel treatment inflicted upon you could cause you to **hate yourself.** We often internalize the negativity directed at us, and we see ourselves negatively just like how we were treated. This tends to lead to serious conditions such as anxiety and depression.

## Honestly, Self-Love is Not Easy

Learning to love myself wasn’t easy. It took a lot of conscious effort and reminders to keep myself in the right state of mind, not falling back into self-hatred. It took me over a year to start feeling more secure in my self-love journey.

<p style="text-align:center;font-size:20px;font-style:italic;padding:20px 0px;">While you can start practicing self-love right at this moment,<br/>keeping it consistent is a different matter.</p>

Self-love isn’t just for a day. It needs to be a lifetime commitment. We need to practice loving ourselves everyday.

It **takes courage** to make that change **from loathing to loving oneself.** Any form of change can be unsettling as we may fear that we won't succeed and will instead return to our old ways. At times, even though we agree that we should love ourselves, we still lack the push to actually take steps to start loving ourselves. We simply do not feel inspired or motivated to start learning to love ourselves.

<p style="text-align:center;font-size:20px;font-style:italic;padding:20px 0px;">If you can start loving yourself for <b>only one reason,</b> hold on to that. Show daily appreciation towards yourself for that one reason.</p>

If loving yourself has been a struggle for you, take it slowly. Don’t set an expectation for yourself, but rather, be gentle towards yourself and let it be. Take your time to observe and think about your positive qualities.

## The Easiest Way to Love Yourself

Through my own journey of self-love, I discovered:

<p style="font-size: 24px; text-align: center;padding:22px 0px;">The <b>easiest</b> way to love ourselves is to start with<br/><b>appreciating our physical presence</b> (body).</p>

**Why?** Despite all the emotional and physical challenges which includes hardships, mistakes, sadness, anger, disappointments, nastiness, unfairness, setbacks, failures&#8212;you name it&#8212;in life, your body is still here supporting yourself!

Your body is still living and breathing. **Every organ in your body is still working and functioning,** enabling you to move about freely and do things as you wish (including daily activities: breathing, eating, walking, sleeping, etc.)

Your body continues to function properly for you, despite all the bad and unhappy things it has to go through. In fact, your physical body is already loving yourself without you realizing it.

And from another angle...

<p style="font-size: 21px; text-align: center;font-style:italic;padding:20px 0px;">Isn’t your body so wonderful and lovable for being strong to put up with all the nonsense and awful things in life?</p>

Thank your body for this.  
Your physical being is something to love yourself for.

## Cultivate Self-Love through Appreciating Your Physical Self

Take some time to think about how your body has been supporting you to accomplish your daily activities. You may want to set aside a few minutes of quiet time to think about what your body does for you everyday and show appreciation. Thank and send love to each and every part of your body.

<div class="box-purple" style="text-align:left; background-color:#ffffff; font-size:1.3rem; font-family:Calibri;color:#000000;padding-bottom:1.3rem;">
<p>- Thank your feet and legs for helping you to move from one place to another.</p>
<p>- Thank your digestive system for helping you to digest all that you eat everyday; to help you cleanse your body by purging unwanted waste and only absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>- Thank your heart for its unwavering strength, as it continuously pumps blood to every part of your body, even during moments of sadness, setbacks, and heartbreaks. Your heart is still beating and keeping you alive despite how emotionally painful it is sometimes.</p>
<p>- Thank your mouth and throat for being able to eat delicious food and talk without difficulty.</p>
<p>- Thank your nose and lungs for helping you to easily breathe in fresh air and exhale, without obstruction.</p>
<p>- Thank your brain for helping you to process thoughts and coming up with smart ways to make things better for you.</p>
</div>

<p style="text-align:center;">Your body and your organs are worthy of your love and appreciation.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;font-size:22px;padding:20px 0px;">As you <b>appreciate</b> your body’s <b>each and every organ's unique function</b>, you're appreciating <b>each and every part of your unique self.</b></p>

You shall not take your physical being for granted. When you appreciate yourself, loving yourself will come naturally.

## Our Bodies and Minds Work Together

Start loving yourself by taking care of your physical body. Give your body the nutrients it needs, the fresh air it needs and the comfort it needs.

<p style="text-align:center;font-size:20px;padding:20px 0px;">All you need to do is to appreciate all that your body is doing for you, right in this moment.</p>

Even though there had been times when you felt depressed and hopeless, you stayed strong and continued fighting.

**Free yourself from the perfect idea of “Happiness”.** You are already enough in the present. [You’re on your way to true happiness as you embrace your present self.](https://sliceofpower.com/2023-11-06-goodbye-happiness-the-key-to-true-happiness/) Ease your stress and anxiety by finding and appreciating the comforts within your present state.
