I’m saying goodbye to happiness. I said bye before and I instantly felt better. If you’re reading this right now, you might go, “Huh? What do you mean ‘goodbye happiness’? What does that even mean?”

To be honest, I was quite amused when I first came across this term. It is actually the title of a song by Japanese-American singer-songwriter, Hikaru Utada. (I’m a huge fan.) It stood out to me when I was watching a really old interview of them discussing about the set list of their concert and how they wanted the song to be presented. The song title suddenly sounded hilarious to me. Right! Goodbye Happiness! What a concept!

On another occasion, on a troubled day, I randomly listened to this song and sang along with it. 

*“So Goodbye Happiness~”*, I instantly felt a sense of relief, as if all my pent up tension were instantly released. The following lines were in Japanese and although I understood the context of the entire song, it wasn't so much about that that brought me a sense of lightness and enlightenment. The song title itself did.

The upbeat melody allowed me to let loose and be free of all obligations as I said goodbye to happiness. At the same time, the idea of Goodbye Happiness cracked me up; it didn't sound right, yet it did as well, as I sang along with the song. This song title really lightened my mood in various ways. It’s a pretty good song too.

Certainly, my focus today isn't on the song. But simply, the idea of saying “goodbye happiness” – feeling free from the never-ending pursuit of happiness. Letting go of the need to achieve something in order to be happy.

Letting go of the perfect idea of “Happiness”.

## Goodbye Happiness – What Does It Mean?

<div style="padding-top: 33px;padding-bottom:15px;">
<li>Quite literally, it means saying bye to happiness!</li>
<li>To <b>let go</b> of the idea of happiness and <b>be in the present.</b></li>
<li>Find comfort in whatever you currently have!</li>
</div>

#### If happiness hasn’t arrived despite having tried so hard, I go by this mindset...
<p style="margin-top: -1px; font-size:17px;"><i>“Screw it! Screw Happiness! I’m just gonna live however I want, do whatever I want and stop being restrained by the thought of happiness.”</i></p>

The idea behind this mentality is that I’m going to stop pursuing happiness. 

Instead, I will just make use of what I have right now and find comfort from within. 

I want to take things easy and do whatever I want right now. Take solace in what I currently have. Whether they constitute “happiness” or not, I’m not going to care anymore, much less care about what others tell me what happiness is.

## Why Say Goodbye Happiness?

At any point in time, we all have a certain definition or idea of what happiness is.

It can be stressful to keep having the thought that we need to “do something” to achieve happiness. Or that the lack of something is blocking us from reaching happiness.

The journey of trying to pursue happiness or a specific goal can seem like a never-ending daunting task. The pursuit of happiness exhausts us, and we may start feeling sad due to how stressful it is.

At times, we only start to realize the happiness we have after comparing our situation against someone else’s. However, making comparisons is not the best approach as [it involves using either your situation or someone’s situation as a benchmark, to see who is better or worse, and gaining relief from it.](https://sliceofpower.com/2023-03-16-how-comparing-can-make-you-miserable/) 

That shouldn’t be how things work. True happiness can only be defined by yourself. You know what you want.

### Reason 1: Goodbye Happiness, to reset your mind.

When you’re are getting tired of pursuing happiness, it is no longer serving you well. Resetting your mind to zero will be helpful.

"Goodbye Happiness" might seem like a negative scenario, as if we are giving up on happiness and that sadness takes over. But that's not the case! Saying goodbye to happiness does not mean that you will immediately feel sad.

It works similarly to how you typically won’t feel "happy" right after crying over something that's making you sad. You will just be in a neutral mood, cleared of whatever emotion that was occupying you. Reset to a balanced state.

In fact, we will stop being sad over the idea of "happiness" or how difficult pursuing our happiness is. We are letting it go.

Feel that instant relief by saying goodbye to happiness - you no longer have to answer for happiness nor do you have to be in a rush to fulfill something. Just do you, at your own pace.

Starting immediately, give yourself space and time to live in the present. Instead of feeling troubled over the thought of happiness, take time to appreciate your present self in this very moment. Free yourself from the burden and focus on the present.

Things are always changing. We can never predict how things will turn out or how circumstances may change that that would affect our journeys.

We cannot control the future nor change the past. We only have control over things in the present.

Trust in the power of the present moment, as it provides you with the best resources. It is up to you to do what you want with it. Find comfort and believe that you are fine as you are right now.

### Reason 2: Goodbye? Happiness is already with you.

Sometimes, we might have to put in the extra effort to discover happiness from within our circumstances when everything feels overwhelming. There is always a little something to be happy and grateful for in our lives. This could be the cute puppy video that you enjoy, random acts of kindness or supportive messages that you have received, to have kept you going till today.

Here's the way to happiness:

If you cannot find something to be happy for…

#### Be happy for yourself. You are your own happiness.

Despite all the chaos in life, you are still here, alive and functioning as best as you can to keep going. You, your mind and body have all helped you to reach where you are today. Isn’t that something to be happy about?

So at any point in time, if you feel that you have not reached your optimum state and don't feel happy, just take a look at what you’ve actually achieved.

Be happy for yourself. Say thank you to yourself for all the roads that you’ve taken, the challenges that you have overcome and your strong will to keep fighting.

## The Way to True Happiness

Free yourself from the burdens of seeking happiness. Relax and live in the moment.

Experience true happiness by embracing and savoring all the comforts that are available to you in this very moment. Appreciate yourself in the moment as well.

[Being in the present enables us to fully experience everything that is around us.](https://time.com/collection/guide-to-happiness/4856944/secrets-happier-life/) Choosing to live in the present can alleviate anxiety, saving your valuable time and mental energy from being consumed by thoughts about the future.

Once you have got hold of your present circumstances, you will be in a better mental state to reach out to happiness. How? In a better frame of mind, you will stop feeling sad, and start taking proactive steps to keep yourself happy; maintain your sense of contentment. But even if you don’t want to do anything extra, that’s fine too.

**The key is happiness is to find comfort in the present**, especially during those moments of burnout when it feels like you cannot move forward. Drop everything, and engage in activities that you enjoy. For example, if watching a show makes you happy, do it right away.

Do what it takes to maintain your inner peace and contentment. It doesn’t matter even if these inner feelings are at low levels at the moment. Recharging yourself by doing what you enjoy would help to build it up.

Once your mind feels more at ease and refreshed, you will have more energy to do more things that continue to contribute to your well-being. These “more things” vary from person to person. It could range from something simple like playing a new game and having fun, to learning a new skill to help you reach your ultimate goal. 

The important thing is to **constantly keep that pleasant state of mind to propel you forward.** 

There is no need to rush either. 

**Just make the best use of the present,** as you are always in the present.
