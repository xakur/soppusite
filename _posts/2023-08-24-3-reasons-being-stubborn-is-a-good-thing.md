excerpt: Stubbornness is a subjective opinion. What I think is stubborn behavior, others might not think so. It’s an observed trait that people give or tell us and vice versa. Most of the time, we probably don’t know when we are being stubborn. Stubbornness is often felt when we see someone hold on to a belief that we deem wrong or unsuitable.

Stubbornness is a subjective opinion. What I think is stubborn behavior, others might not think so. It’s an observed trait that people give or tell us and vice versa. Most of the time, we probably don’t know when we are being stubborn.

## Understanding the Meaning of Stubborn 

Stubborn can be understood as being resistant to change. A stubborn person has a strong determination to stick to their opinions and actions. It is often difficult to persuade or influence a stubborn person due to their strong will.

## When do We Identify Stubborn Behavior?

We spot stubborn behavior when someone persists in holding onto a belief we consider incorrect or inappropriate, even after being advised. Typically, we notice stubborn behavior when either a decision or an action is required - the person involved insists on doing what they want, disregarding other suggestions. We thus see them as stubborn in their thinking or ways, as they are not receptive to change or better ideas. We think that they are not doing the right thing.

#### However, are they really wrong in their beliefs?

As much as we have our reasons for giving suggestions, they *might* have their strong reasons for insisting on their stance. **Stubborn or not, it is a matter of perspective.**

## Are You Stubborn?

As mentioned above, whether someone is considered stubborn or not depends on varying perspectives.

So when someone accuses you of being stubborn, it's **up to you to decide** whether or not that's true. Do you have valid reasoning to back up your stance?

You don’t necessarily have to be affected by what they said as there is always a limitation on our capacity to fathom another person’s situation and vice versa. [If you do not feel comfortable hearing what someone else said (be it out of a positive or negative intent), the words are not meant for you. You have the choice to accept or reject it.](https://sliceofpower.com/2022-11-19-5-tips-on-becoming-unaffected-by-what-people-say/)

On the other hand, however, if someone else's words make sense to you and you start questioning your thoughts and intentions, it will be wise to reevaluate your decision by considering all possible choices or suggestions.

This is not to make them happy or to prove who is correct; rather, it is to provide you with a better understanding of your situation so that you may make the best choice for which you are willing to be accountable for.

## The Drawbacks of Being Stubborn

Before moving to the 3 reasons why being stubborn is a good thing, let's first take a look at how being stubborn is a **bad** thing:

<h4 style="font-size: 1.185rem; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 1px;"><li>You might be doing the wrong thing or ignoring the consequences.</li></h4>

As stated earlier, stubbornness is a matter of perspective. People might think that you’re doing something wrong, though you might not think so. Well-intended people might voice their concerns telling you why you should or should not do certain things.

They might find you stubborn if you insist on your stance or refuse to look at things from their perspective.

**_However, as long as it doesn't involve breaking the law and harming others, who is able to truly determine what is right or wrong?_** At times, even if we are already aware of the consequences of an issue, we choose to ignore them and do what we think is best. 

Whichever it is, it is important to hold yourself accountable at the end of the day.

<h4><b>How to resolve this?</b></h4>
<p>To ensure that your stubbornness or resolute mindset is not sabotaging you, you may want to list your reasons for a certain decision. Ideally, weigh the pros and cons of doing and not doing it.</p>
<p>Consider all angles, including what others might have told you. No one said that you must listen to what others tell you, but taking into account of other suggestions or advice can help you reach a well-informed decision. This is especially helpful when dealing with a serious issue.</p>
<p>When looking at the downsides of the decision, <b>evaluate if you are prepared to bear the consequences if the worst case scenario happens.</b></p>
<p>Always remember that you only have to answer to yourself at the end of the day. Whether you choose to listen to the words of others, you must be responsible and bear the consequences of your own actions, if anything were to go wrong.</p>
</div>

<h4 style="font-size: 1.185rem; font-weight: bold;"><li>It prevents you from growing.</li></h4>

When you are stubborn, you tend to resist change - new ways of doing things and new perspectives. This resistance to change can prevent you from picking up new skills and knowledge to adapt to evolving situations. You might not be able to keep up with the times.

Stagnation can occur if you refuse to consider different perspectives or make improvements from past mistakes. Refusing to be open-minded and clinging to your own perspectives without considering other viewpoints can hinder your personal growth, as it restricts your exposure to more knowledge and information.

<div class="imgtext-container" style="display: block; background-color: #fcff9269; padding-top:30px; padding-left:30px; padding-right:30px; padding-bottom:10px; margin-bottom:40px;">
<h4><b>How to resolve this?</b></h4>
<p>If you really insist on doing what you want without considering other options, you can give it a try first. However, <b><i>if keeping to an old mindset does not bring about an improvement or if things do not turn out well,</i></b> you need to start realizing that you need to change for the better. There is no point in keeping to an approach that does not work for you anymore.</p>
<p>When you start welcoming new ideas, you may find that there are various options to choose from. Although a new idea or approach may not be the best for you in that moment, it might be helpful to you someday in the future. Thinking it through would more or less offer insights that might help you.</p>
<p>So instead of rejecting all other ideas/suggestions immediately, adopt an open mind. Give yourself various options to consider, but ultimately follow what you think is best for you. See how it goes, and then make adjustments accordingly. Be open to new ideas.</p>

## How is Being Stubborn a Good Thing?

<h3 style="padding-top: 40px;">1. You only need to answer to yourself. Not anyone else.</h3>

It is fine to stay firm to your beliefs and decisions as this is your life, and you only need to answer to yourself.

However, if your actions could impact others, be it a certain decision in a matter or a belief that you’re holding, you need to consider the opinions of others as well. For this scenario, you should spare a thought for others too. Otherwise, being stubborn can lead to selfishness as you are only concerned about your own needs. [In a team setting especially at work, stubborn people are seen as selfish and challenging to work with.](https://www.elitedaily.com/life/stubborn-people-self-assured/1192404)

If the decision or issue at hand only involves yourself, you are always free to do what you think is best, as long as you have valid reasons for making a certain decision or holding on to a belief. 

Same as for the outcome, whether or not things turn out well, no one other than you is accountable for it. If something bad happens, you should not run away from it or push the blame to others. **Being responsible for your own actions is most important.**

If we encounter something bad due to our stubbornness, all we have to do is to learn and improve from there. We change as we grow in life.

As our life situations change over time, we may even begin to realize that certain beliefs that we have held are no longer doing us any good. Life situations change and we start to accept new beliefs that would better fit into our current lives. This includes beliefs that we were once resistant to. There are also times in life where we would realize later on that our past actions and thoughts were not for the best, just like what people had once told us.

Whichever it is, we learn as we grow. We never really know who is right or wrong till we experienced it ourselves.

Therefore, following your heart and doing what you think is best is most important at the end of the day. It is your life, you make the decision and you take the responsibility for it. Our mistakes will help us learn.

### 2. You’re firm on your stance.

No one can easily influence your decisions or even your character. There’s beauty in staying true to your values, as long as it’s not something that offends the law or other people. 

When you’re firm on your stance, you’re very likely to persevere through any obstacles to see a task to completion. The act of being grounded to your values provides a firm basis. **When you are loyal to your values and beliefs, you are likely to be loyal to your path and have the conviction to see an issue through.** In some cases, the values that you are loyal to lay the path for your actions and these very same values continue to motivate you in your journey to reach your goal.

Being firm in your beliefs can also help you to have less decision-making dilemmas. You will have less difficulty in making up your mind when your beliefs are able to guide you to make a decision. You’re normally clear of what you want to do and you won’t ponder too much over it. It saves you time too.

### 3. You know what you want and follow your heart.

At the end of the day, you only need to follow your heart and mind.

**It’s better to follow your heart than to regret not doing what you had wanted to do** because someone told you not to. It is important to be true to yourself and be responsible of your own actions.

It’s a matter of perspective and whether you want to consider multiple other perspectives. Due to differences in perspectives, people might think that you’re stubborn when you insist on your perspective. Sometimes though, this has nothing to do with being stubborn. During the times when I was called stubborn, I actually had concrete reasons to back up my decisions. I’m not one to make decisions loosely.

Therefore, while being stubborn might not entirely be a bad thing, it is important to be open-minded and expose yourself to various other ideas and experiences, instead of rejecting them immediately. Give it a chance for consideration at least. Other suggestions or new approaches might help to make things easier for you.

Upon evaluating various ideas, if you still strongly wish to go with your original intention, you can ultimately go ahead with your decision. By considering and evaluating the issue from various angles, it helps you to make a well-informed decision.

You can stop second-guessing yourself if someone keeps questioning you or forcing their ideas upon you even after you’ve thoroughly reviewed the matter. **It is never a waste of time to consider other options.** The evaluation speaks for itself and you can be confident to go with your decision.

## Conclusion

Stubbornness is a subjective viewpoint. Whether you call yourself stubborn or not, it is always helpful to consider and evaluate all perspectives. Follow your heart after thoroughly reviewing the matter. It is better than to regret doing or not doing something because you chose to listen to what others have told you. After all, this is your life. You are entitled to make your own choices. Always hold yourself accountable in everything that you do.
