The collected information may include a visitor’s IP address, operating system, browser ID, browsing activity and other information. However, to enhance privacy and data protection, we have implemented measures to mask the IP addresses collected by Piwik PRO. This means that the full IP addresses are not stored or visible to us, ensuring that your identity remains anonymous in the analytics data. See the [scope of data collected by Piwik PRO](https://help.piwik.pro/support/getting-started/what-data-does-piwik-pro-collect/).
