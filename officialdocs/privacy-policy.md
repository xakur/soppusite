We collect certain non-personally identifiable information automatically when you visit our website. This information may include your IP address, browser type, operating system, referring website, pages visited, and other usage statistics. We collect this information to analyze trends, administer the site, track user engagement, and gather demographic information.

The anonymized data helps us understand trends, improve user experiences, and analyze website performance. 

This website does not use cookies on its own. However, we utilize third-party cookies to enhance user experience and provide personalized content. These third-party services, such as analytics tools and advertising networks, may collect non-personally identifiable information, including IP addresses, browser types, and device details, to analyze website usage and deliver relevant advertisements.

We use Piwik PRO Analytics Suite as our website/app analytics software and consent management tool.

The collected information may include a visitor’s IP address, operating system, browser ID, browsing activity and other information. However, to enhance privacy and data protection, we have implemented measures to mask the IP addresses collected by Piwik PRO. This means that the full IP addresses are not stored or visible to us, ensuring that your identity remains anonymous in the analytics data. See the [scope of data collected by Piwik PRO](https://help.piwik.pro/support/getting-started/what-data-does-piwik-pro-collect/).

We calculate metrics like bounce rate, page views, sessions and the like to understand how our website/app is used. We may also create visitors’ profiles based on browsing history to analyze visitor behavior, show personalized content and run online campaigns.

We host our solution on Microsoft Azure in Germany/Netherlands/United States/Hong Kong/ElastX in Sweden, and the data is stored for 14/25 months.

The purpose of data processing: analytics and conversion tracking based on consent. Legal basis: Art. 6 (1)(a) GDPR.
