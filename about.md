We tend to feel lonely when we have difficulty blending into the society, or when social norms do not line up with ours. When there is a lack of understanding and emotional support from people around us, the sense of loneliness can be immense and affect our daily lives.

### About the Author - Kai Ecils

<blockquote style="color:#484848; font-size:17px;">
  <p>Thank you for visiting Slice of Power! Here’s a short introduction of myself...</p>
  <p>I’m not quite the ordinary person being brought to and raised in this world. And so, ordinary or typical words and methods don’t work very well for me.</p>
  <p>Through <b>Slice of Power</b>, I hope to provide an alternative voice, words of advice or a different approach in general to help others, in the same way like how I was supported.</p>
  <p>Growing up, I did not have the emotional support and understanding I needed from the people around me. It was painful. I could only find and create my own support. Thankfully, I received support from the least expected of places, by fate.</p>
  <p>I have been very lucky to meet other similar souls to guide me through difficult times. By similar souls, I don't mean people I've met in person. Instead, these souls are usually coincidental meetings with people I’ve only “met” briefly—their words, their vibe, or even tunes that I connect with.</p>
  <p>When you are different from the norms, you need to seek your own resources and support, because no one is going to automatically give you what you need. I am really grateful towards these supportive words of random strangers I encountered in life.</p>
  <p>I was able to heal and become stronger on my own. The enlightenment received made me realize that all I needed was myself. I want to spread the same support and message to more people. We don't need anyone else to always be by our side. We are fine on our own. Through the power of our minds.</p>
  <p>Form your own Power, Be your own Slice of Power!</p>
